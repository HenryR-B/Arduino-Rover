# Arduino-Rover
I developed and tested a wheeled robot with the ability to move autonomously using independent motors that I coded to respond to the proximity of objects in its environment. For sure the most exciting part of this robot project for me was coding to simultaneously control the tasks of its on-board systems (servos, ultrasonic sensors, LEDs, motors).
